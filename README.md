### Applied Learning Project

In this Specialization you will use AR to create three travel posters about your next dream vacation.

Poster 1 is an African safari where users will scan the QR code on the poster to trigger the AR experience. The experience begins with a slider. As the player moves the slider, the landscape brightens as the sun rises, revealing the animals in their habitat. 

Poster 2 is a mountain fishing adventure where the users will scan a QR code on the poster of a mountain and stream landscape. Then the user will be able to use the Meta Spark face effect. 

The last poster 3 is a tropical island experience with a full 3D environment appearing perpendicular to the poster. Players will be asked to clean the beach, and upon completing that task, will discover a new friend. 

To create these posters, you will use Meta Spark Hub, Patch Editor, QR code, sliders, scaling, patch assets, Sprite Sheet, face tracking, segmentation, Plane Tracker, audio and game logic.
